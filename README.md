## About AviUtl Installer Script
This is a collection of scripts created with the purpose of simplifying the complex and difficult task for beginners of install and setting up the AviUtl main body and several essential plugins for video editing using AviUtl, so that it can be done by executing just one file.

To make it easier to run in many environments, it is in .cmd (batchfile) format, but the contents are mostly Windows PowerShell (5.x) scripts.

### Operating Environment
